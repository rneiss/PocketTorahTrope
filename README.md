# PocketTorah Trope
This repo contains the completely rewritten code that powers the PocketTorah Trope [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pockettorah-trope/id497873394?mt=8). And eventually the Android one as well

We're now using React-Native, which should allow us to update more quickly than every five years or so, and allow others to more easily submit pull requests.

### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/rneiss/PocketTorahTrope/
cd /PocketTorah                            
npm install
npm run setup
```

_Special thanks to [Rabbi Michael Farbman](http://tegnh.org/rabbi-michael-farbman/) and his 6th graders at Temple Emanuel of Greater New Haven in providing the incentive to get this iOS 11 compatible version out to the world_
