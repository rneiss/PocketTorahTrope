# PocketTorah
This repo contains the completely rewritten code that powers the PocketTorah [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pockettorah/id515833985?mt=8). And eventually the Android one as well

We're now using React-Native, which should allow us to update more quickly than every five years or so, and allow others to more easily submit pull requests.

### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/rneiss/PocketTorah/
cd /PocketTorah                            
npm install
npm run setup
```
